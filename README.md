# Finite Element Method - Electromagnetism
Using Finite Element Method (FEM) on solving Electromagnetism problems. Some of the applications are:

- Electric Potential inside a Cylindrical Capacitor ($2b = 3.5mm$ and $2a = 1.52mm$)
- Electrical Potential of a Parallel Plate Capacitor ($w = 4cm$, $t = 2mm$, $d = 1$ and $\epsilon_r = 2.2$)
